# sat-solver

A skeleton for the sat-solver.
Note: The automatic git-hub tests are unofficial (but useful) and cover only the 10 initial tests.
After the deadline, 10 additional tests are run off-line with 1 minute timeout.
The official score is the one from full off-line testing.

Usage:

```
# compile the tester (and possibly the solver, if in Haskell)
make

# run the tests (requires an executable binary "./sat-solver")
./check.sh
```
